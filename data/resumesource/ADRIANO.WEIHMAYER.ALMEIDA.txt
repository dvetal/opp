I am a Business Intelligence professional that is searching to become a Data Science expert. With more than 6 years experience in BI implementation and support, 7 years managing support and implementation teams and more then 10 years working with IT, I am convinced that data can change the world, if properly used. As a multi-talented, polyglot, proactive, experienced professional winner of some internal innovation prizes I will probably be a good addition to your team.
